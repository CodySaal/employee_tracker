# Employee Tracker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

The user can clone the code from the GitHub repo. Once the code is cloned and opened in a code editor the user should install all npm packages by running `npm i`. The user will also have to create a .env file in order to store their credentials for the connection. The user needs a DB_USER and DB_NAME within the .env. If the user has a password on their mysql they will also need a DB_PASSWORD which will also need to be put within the connection variable.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
